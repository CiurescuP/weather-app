# weather-app
API Weather App with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
Working with API for the first time, this was by far the most interesting project so far. I got the API from https://openweathermap.org/api and I got it by country, not by states. I had lots of fun coding the Weather App, and by watching others doing their versions, I have learned so much more! Also, it was my first time designing (adding the images) through Javascript.
